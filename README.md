# Webpack Isomorphic Loader

Webpack loader and tools to extend NodeJS `require` so it understands your web asset files such as images when you are doing server side rendering (SSR).

It contains three pieces: a webpack loader and plugin, and a library for your NodeJS app.

The webpack loader and plugin are for marking and generating a mapping for your asset files.

The Node library is for extending NodeJS `require` so it understands your asset files by using the mapping.

## Install

```
$ npm install isomorphic-loader --save
```

## Purpose

With [webpack] and [file-loader], you can do things like this in your React code:

```js
import smiley from "./images/smiley.jpg";


render() {
    return <div><img src={smiley} /></div>
}
```

That works out nicely, but if you need to do SSR, you will get SyntaxError from Node `require`.  That's because `require` only understand JS files.

With this module, you can extend Node's `require` so it will understand these files.

It saves a list of your files that you want to be treated as assets and the extended `require` will return the URL string like it would on the client side.

## Usage

### Configuring Webpack

First you need to mark all your asset files that you want `extendRequire` to handle.  To do that, simply use the webpack loader `isomorphic-loader` on the files.

> The webpack loader `isomorphic-loader` is just a simple pass thru loader to mark your files.  It will not do anything to the file content.

You also need to install the webpack plugin `isomorphic-loader/lib/webpack-plugin` to collect and save the list of the files you marked.

For example, in the webpack config, to mark the usual image files to be understood by `extendRequire`:

```js
var IsomorphicLoaderPlugin = require("isomorphic-loader/lib/webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
    plugins: [
        new IsomorphicLoaderPlugin()
    ],
    module: {
        loaders: [
            {
                test: /\.(jpe?g|png|gif|svg)$/i,
                loader: "file!isomorphic"
            }
        ]
    }
};
```

You can also mark any file in your code directly:

```js
import smiley from "file!isomorphic!./images/smiley.jpg";
```

After webpack compiled your project, the plugin will generate a config file `.isomorphic-loader-config.json` in your `CWD` and a JSON file with mappings of the asset files you marked.

[more details about config and assets mapping files below](#config-and-assets-files).


### Extending Node Require

To use the asset files mapping for SSR with Node, you need to extend `require` before your server starts.

To do that:

```js
var extendRequire = require("isomorphic-loader/lib/extend-require");

extendRequire(function (err) {
    if (err) {
        console.log(err);
    } else {
        require("./server");
    }
});
```

If `Promise` is supported:

```js
extendRequire().then(function () {
    require("./server");
}).catch(function (err) {
    console.log(err);
});
```

It will use the config file `.isomorphic-loader-config.json` in your `CWD` generated by the webpack plugin.

If the config file is not found, then it will wait until it's generated.  This is so you can use [webpack-dev-server].

### webpack-dev-server

[webpack-dev-server] is automatically detected and supported.

> There is no easy way to detect [webpack-dev-server], but if you use its CLI, then it changes `output.path` to `"/"`.  Since it's unlikely anyone would do that, when that is the case it's assumed [webpack-dev-server] is running.

The webpack plugin accepts an object `webpackDev` in the options with two configs for [webpack-dev-server].

  * `webpackDev.url` - The URL to the server.  ***Default:*** `http://localhost:8080`.
  * `webpackDev.addUrl` - A flag to toggle adding the dev URL to the final asset URL.  ***Default:*** `true`

In example:

```js
new IsomorphicLoaderPlugin({
    webpackDev: {
        url: "http://localhost:8080",
        addUrl: true
    }
});
```

With the above config, your assets will be resolved to `http://localhost:8080/<publicPath>/<hash>.<ext>`.

> They are resolved to `<publicPath>/<hash>.<ext>` if `webpackDev.addUrl` is `false`.

When [webpack-dev-server] refresh modified files, `extendRequire` will also auto refresh.

#### Reloading Assets for Extend Require

It's not necessary, but if at any time you wish `extendRequire` to reload the assets, then you can use the `loadAssets` API.

```js
var extendRequire = require("isomorphic-loader/lib/extend-require");

extendRequire.loadAssets(true, function (err) {
    if (err) {
        console.log(err);
    }
});
```

### Config and Assets Files

The webpack plugin creates a config file in your `CWD` and an assets mapping file in your webpack output directory.

The default name of the mapping file is `isomorphic-assets.json`.

You can configure the name when you initialize the plugin.  For example:

```js
new IsomorphicLoaderPlugin({assetsFile: "assets/isomorphic-assets.json"});
```

It will also save in the config the `publicPath` from your webpack config.

Here is how the generated config file might look like:

```json
{
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "context": "client",
  "output": {
    "path": "dist",
    "filename": "bundle.js",
    "publicPath": "/test/"
  },
  "webpackDev": {
    "url": "http://localhost:8080",
    "addUrl": true
  },
  "isWebpackDev": false,
  "assetsFile": "dist/isomorphic-assets.json"
}
```

Since [webpack-dev-server] keep output in memory, the assets mapping is saved to the config also when it's detected.
